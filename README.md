# Hack the North Frontend 2016 Challenge Starter Kit

This is a minimal starter kit in order to have you diving into the challenge with no setup hassle. There is a requirement for having NodeJS setup in order to use this.

## Usage

__Close this repository (DO NOT FORK!):__

`git clone git@github.com:hackthenorth/frontend-challenge-starter.git`

__Install the dependencies:__

First we need to all of the packages required in order to run the development server.

`npm install`



__Development mode with livereload:__

For developing you will need to start the dev server which watches files for changes in order to recompile. When you make edits you just need to refresh the page to see the changes.

`npm run watch`


__When you're completed__

Make a new Github repository of your own, push your code to that repository, and send us the link!
